## 📖 Introduction

This README serves as a weekly journal of my month-long remote internship at **Graphionic Infotech**. During this time, I worked on two real-world AI applications involving **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, vector databases, and modern APIs. The journey was a mix of coding, exploration, integration, and deployment.

## 🗓 Weekly Highlights

### Week 1 (May 15 – May 21): Kickoff & Setup
- Completed onboarding and gained clarity on project expectations.
- Explored AWS Bedrock, Claude, and Meta’s LLaMA2 models.
- Set up development environment and integrated FAISS for vector search.
- Understood RAG architecture and embedding pipelines.

### Week 2 (May 22 – May 28): RAG-Powered Chatbot
- Built ingestion module to embed documents and store vectors.
- Integrated FAISS for fast semantic search.
- Connected Claude and LLaMA2 for grounded response generation.
- Developed CLI-based chatbot to interact with embedded knowledge.
- Compared LLMs in terms of response tone and factual accuracy.

### Week 3 (May 29 – June 4): YouTube Summarization Tool
- Extracted video transcripts using the YouTube Data API.
- Employed Gemini Pro to create various summary formats (bullet, TL;DR, paragraph).
- Implemented transcript chunking and prompt structuring.
- Built a simple and interactive UI using Streamlit.

### Week 4 (June 5 – June 15): Final Touches
- Improved both tools for performance and usability.
- Finalized documentation for end-users and developers.
- Participated in final demo presentation to mentor.
- Learned about model behavior, testing, and deployment best practices.
